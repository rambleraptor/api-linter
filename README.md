# AEP Protobuf Linter

[![ci](https://github.com/aep-dev/api-linter/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aep-dev/api-linter/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)
![latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/aep-dev/api-linter)
![go version](https://img.shields.io/github/go-mod/go-version/aep-dev/api-linter)

The API linter provides real-time checks for compliance with many of the API
standards, documented using [API Enhancement Proposals](https://aep.dev). It operates on API
surfaces defined in [protocol buffers][]. 

For APIs using the 
[OpenAPI Specification][], an equivalent [OpenAPI linter](https://github.com/aep-dev/aep-openapi-linter) is
available.

It identifies common mistakes and inconsistencies in API surfaces:

```proto
// Incorrect: Do not use the resource type as the field name here.
message GetBookRequest {
  // Field names for resource identifiers in Get requests must be `name`.
  // Tools and standards expect this for consistency and interoperability.
  string book = 1;
}
```
When able, it also offers a suggestion for the correct fix.
```proto
// Correct: This version follows AEP-148, which requires resource identifiers in Get requests to use the field name `name`.
// See https://aep.dev/148/ for details.
message GetBookRequest {
  // The name of the book to retrieve.
  // Format: publishers/{publisher}/books/{book}
  string name = 1;
}
```

## Versioning

The AEP API linter does **not** follow semantic versioning. Semantic
versioning is challenging for a tool like a linter because the addition or
correction of virtually any rule is "breaking" (in the sense that a file that
previously reported no problems may now do so).

Therefore, the version numbers refer to the linter's core interface. In
general:

- Releases with only documentation, chores, dependency upgrades, and/or
  bugfixes are patch releases.
- Releases with new rules (or potentially removed rules) are minor releases.
- Releases with core interface alterations are major releases. This could
  include changes to the internal Go interface or the CLI user interface.

**Note:** Releases that increment the Go version will be considered minor.

This is an attempt to follow the spirit of semantic versioning while still
being useful.
